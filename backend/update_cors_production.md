# CORS Fix for Production

## Problem
The AI chat API is failing with CORS error because the production frontend URL is not included in the CORS origins configuration.

## Error Details
```
Access to fetch at 'https://backend-production-cb0c.up.railway.app/api/ai/chat' from origin 'https://frontend-production-4991.up.railway.app' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## Solution
Update the `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable in Railway production to include the correct frontend URL.

### Steps to Fix:

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**
   - Navigate to your backend project
   - Go to Variables tab

2. **Update CORS_ORIGINS variable**
   - Find the `CORS_ORIGINS` variable
   - Update it to: `http://localhost:3000,https://frontend-production-4991.up.railway.app`
   - Save the changes

3. **Redeploy the backend**
   - Railway should automatically redeploy when you save the environment variable
   - Or manually trigger a redeploy if needed

### Alternative: Add via Railway CLI
```bash
railway variables set CORS_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000,https://frontend-production-4991.up.railway.app"
```

## Verification
After updating the environment variable and redeploying:
1. Check the backend logs to see: `CORS Origins configured: ['http://localhost:3000', 'https://frontend-production-4991.up.railway.app']`
2. Test the AI chat functionality in production
3. The CORS error should be resolved

## Code Changes Made
1. Updated `backend/env.example` with correct production URL
2. Improved CORS configuration in `backend/server.py` with better error handling
3. Added CORS preflight handler for AI chat endpoint
4. Added logging for CORS configuration debugging
